# Agent-Maze-SDK

A project developed by WPS Lakerbotics Programming to further practice our understanding of
2d arrays, and manipulating agents.

Required python libraries:
  * Numpy
  * Pygame

HOW TO USE:
1. Creating a map
   - Run 'builder.py'
   - When finished, press the "enter" key to save map to 'map.txt' and 'map.pkl'
2. Running the map
   - Run 'environment.py'
   - See the agent do its work
   
Optional
   - Environment by default loads from map.pkl, but it can be reconfigured to load just the grid
   from map.txt
   - Map/grid can be viewed in its raw form in map.txt
